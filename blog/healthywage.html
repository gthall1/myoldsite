            <p>22 Jan 2015</p>

            <p>Before I approached a proposal to how I would create a more engaging dashboard I wanted to make a few improvements to the existing challenge pages.  I think some of these slight changes could enhance the user experience and create a more intuitive and visually appealing flow through the data and information for the challenges.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <p><font color="red">1. </font>This is very important territory here above the fold, and there are way more valuable things to place heres besides a generic quote. Let's put some goals here to give users small steps on their way to their target weight</p>
        <p><font color="red">2. </font>This graph is a little confusing and takes a minute to figure out. Let's clearly define the time period. Also, when a new weight is entered the current weight changes but the graph does not. If the jQuery from the modal cannot change the graph too then lets have the page refresh to reflect the newly entered weight; both need to change to reflect to new weight</p>
        <p><font color="red">3. </font>This is going to change to My Dashboard as reflected in the image below. The landing page/dashboard should reflect user progress and accomplishments</p>
        <p><font color="red">4. </font>From the limited data I have access to this chat is not a very well adopted feature. Only 46% of posts were bragging about success or encouraging others, as it is intended.  An alarming 46% also used it for troubleshooting which should not go in this area; that could be quickly addressed just by adding Olark to your site. And 8% of the posts were from a dissatisfied customer notifying all other users in the challenge why she disliked your product and was leaving your service. This is better done elsewhere, we don't want a forum where other users could be encouraged to leave as well.</p>
        <p><font color="red">5. </font>This is a frustrating user experience. This data is quite pertinent, and I as a user don't want to have to go clicking on a different section each time I want to read/learn details about the challenge. A much cleaner and efficient design could clean up this mess and present the data in a much more user friendly approach</p>
        <p><font color="red">6. </font>Some good info, but lets tuck that up by the checkbox in the form of a question mark icon, and if you hover on the icon then this alert will display; proximity here is key to be clear for the user</p>
        <p><font color="red">7. </font>Once again, a user shouldn't have to click to see this info. Good info once you click through, but I'd like to see lbs added to the chart. You lose lbs much faster than a % of your body fat, and it's easier to measure, so it's more appealing to see a user's progress in whole numbers</p>
        <p><font color="red">8. </font>This is a great growth hacking tool behind this click section. Like before lets eliminate this extra required click, and just have three icons: twitter, facebook, and email icons, and if you click on the email one then the additional supplied email features you already have pop up in a modal</p>
        <p><font color="red">9. </font>Aside from blasting out a post, you should be able to connect to facebook with oAuth and see other friends who are using Healthywage and compete against them in challenges, bets, etc. Everything is more fun and engaging when it's social with your friends</p>
        <p><font color="red">10. </font>Eliminate the click. Also, you should be able to click on a team and see the team members and their progress both as individuals and as a team (unless they have chosen security features that disallow sharing of some kind)</p>
        <p><font color="red">11. </font>Eliminate this section. The prizes should clearly be displayed at the top of the challenge. This is arguably the most important aspect to any challenge</p>
        <p><font color="red">12. </font>No real opposition to the mini challenges, but I'd like to see the data on how engaged users were. There was a missed opportunity by employees to not mention this in the chat feature that was sorely under unitilzed.  Also, it looks bad to other users when none of the mini challenges have any votes.  Let's take out all the "0 votes" until we actually get some votes in there. Add team names too; "69th place" is really confusing</p>
        <p><font color="red">13. </font>This is arguably the only section that could actually justify having an expanding section; I would still lean against it though</p>
        <p><font color="red">14. </font>Confusing here, is it Team lbs Lost? Or is it My lbs Lost? Also, is our rank 112 out of 112, or is my team ranked 112 out of 55,108 teams? Lets make this a lot more clear</p>
        <p><font color="red">15. </font>You are <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/news-from-the-field/Eyes-on-the-Prize-Is-Now-a-Scientific-Principle.html?utm_source=nftf&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=01202015&" target="_blank">much more likely to reach a goal</a> if you have a target. Let's help the user keep their eye on the prize at all times and display their target weight along with their current weight</p>

            <h1 class="arrow">Healthywage Dashboard</h1>
            <p>Some of the changes from above are reflected here, but I really wanted to focus on a new dashboard.  The dashboard itself should be a place where the user cannot wait to log in and see their progress.  I envision the dashboard being a place that records daily accomplishments and constantly encourages them to stay on track to accomplish their goals.  I've proposed a chart that displays a user's daily activity.  This would take info and account for all activity furing the day so it would not only reflect their workout but also things like walking to lunch or biking to work.  To track these metrics the user could manually input the data, or better yet Healthywage could use Fitbit's (and numerous other company's) easy api to allow users to connect their wearable technology to their Healthywage account.  This would provide all kinds of useful data that could really engage HW users and help them achieve their goals. As we've seen over the last few months, wearable technology is definitely the future, and it's just another way to get people excited about Healthywage and accomplishing their goals as well as improving the HW experience.</p>

            <p>To gamify the dashboard and the HW experience I've introduced the concept of pins.  These would be awarded for achieving certain goals like completing a mile run, working out 3 days in a row, or for reaching 50,000 calories burned.  These could also encourage user behavior such as the Facebook pin or the Fitbit pin for connecting your accounts.  To take that a step further, pins could be another monetization strategy: the "Jenny" pin for checking in at a Jenny Craig center or the "Marathoner" pin for checking in at the local marathon, and those organizations would pay as a form of native advertising to encourage user behavior.  The points associated with the pins are also a great way to create daily, weekly, etc competitions among users, as well as encourage personal bests.  And then you've got to offer a way for people to share these pins/daily accomplishments.  People will only share the same thing (like a specific HW Challenge) one time, but that dopamine rush of the digital pat on the back (a like or a favorite) is what will keep people sharing their accomplishments and receiving support on the path to accomplishing their goals.</p>

            <p>I also think the social aspect is key.  Accomplishing any goal, especially difficult ones, is always better when you can do it with friends.  Adding the ability to sign in with Facebook will add a social component that is lacking in the experience, and not only increase user engagement but also increase sharing of your product as well.  The majority of peoples' lives are on Facebook already, so it adds validity and numerous tools to enhance the product.</p>
