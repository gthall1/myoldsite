            <p>With the emergence of Meerket this week and their rocket fueled explosion of popularity it is quite clear that the conversion of live video entertainment and social media is upon us.  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/04/twitter-in-talks-with-live-streaming-app-periscope/" target="_blank">Twitter will soon buy a live-streaming company</a> and add that feature into their product, GoPro has recently partnered with Vislink for live broadcasts, and a host of others (Twitch, Livestream, Upclose, Younow) are trying their hand at the market.  Although Meerkat is the only one with the ephemerality of disappearing content I doubt it will be too long before Snapchat incorporates a livestream too.  So who wins in this new wave of content providers?  The product that wins will be the one that is easiest to use for the largest demographic to create <em>quality</em> content.</p>

            <p>As a product manager I couldn't help diving in and thinking about the software side of the product.  I believe, in a nutshell, that these features will enhance what I'm sure is already a very good product:  make it easy for users by providing tools, show them how to use it, encourage through contests and competitions, and provide product functionality to spread exponentially quicker than the traditional model.</p>

            <p>Trace has a unique opportunity to capitalize on a content platform where industry leaders have failed thusfar, and that is with the creation of user friendly editing software and sharing features.  Look at the perfect example from the medium of still photography: Instagram.  They made it painstakingly easy for a user to upload a photo, throw a filter on it and voil√†! post a pic that looks good.  What was intriguing and drove user retention is that it easily turned crappy pictures into decent looking ones, so all of a sudden users felt like they were photographers.  This drives growth on both sides: viewers are more likely to spend time on the platform because the quality of content is better, and content creators are more likely to share because they can quickly make their photos look better and worth sharing.  But even Instagram has failed in video editing up to this point: you can't parse together clips, you can't add music, etc.  Any quality video you see on Instagram has been edited elsewhere. (as a sidenote, Instagram has definitely made strides in their mobile video editing capabilities as evidenced by their release of Hyperlapse)</p>

            <p>A quick competitive analysis shows that while GoPro has made efforts to help their users create better content with their free downloadable software, Youtube has done next to nothing.  Millions of people still upload video to Youtube daily, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to sift through the piles of garbage to get to content worth watching.  This is the basis for Youtube following in the footsteps of MTV; not focusing on what made their company great (music/user generated content) and instead increasingly driving user retention through the prevelance of corporate ($) driven channels.  Individual users are losing their voice as the influence of big dollars is now steering content creation and consumtion.  GoPro hasn't knocked it out of the park with their aforementioned software either because it is still not user friendly, and by user friendly I mean "non-technical user" friendly.  The GoPro software offers little more than the iMovie software that comes on macs other than GoPro branding, a couple of their professionally edited example videos, and a decent onboarding process that shows you where tools are but not how to use them.</p>

            <p>Make uploading, editing, and posting a video so easy and intuitive that non-technical people under the age of 10 or over 60 are able to create and edit quality content.  Don't put the tools in software that you have to download because the majority of people aren't going to take a lot of time to learn editing software to make good edits.  Put the editing software in the browser on desktop where users can go to the site, edit quickly and intuitively with tools that make their footage better than it is (5 mins or less), then post.  Exactly what Instagram did for mobile photos.  Instagram reduced photoshop editing of photos to a quick and simple process for creating good looking photos and whoever does that for video, eliminating the need for iMovie, Adobe, GoPro software, etc is going to quickly become a major player in the content creation/sharing space.  (<a href="https://vimeo.com/110853825" target="_blank">Shutterstock has just introcuded their in-browser editing app</a> but they're more focused on selling their content than providing users a place to share their own creations)  It's sad but just this week I've seen multiple <a href="http://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/web/4913475640.html" target="_blank">ads on Craigslist</a> seeking video editors for Youtube.  The tools are free and available, but people refuse to take the time to learn and get good at it, so I believe the answer is to make it much easier and less time consuming for them to edit and post quality content.</p>

            <p>The next feature that would be incredibly beneficial would be lessons in using the software.  I would get talented content producers, videographers, etc to do a "how to" or "like a pro" series of tips and tricks that show users how to make quality content with YOUR software.  The future of this industry, as Youtube has seen, is not content but <em>quality</em> content creation.  The majority of their retention is in channels now such as Red Bull's and this is why GoPro is spending big money teaching their athletes how to film better content.  This is what retains users and inspires others to create better quality content.  Even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Thid6WfiY" target="_blank">simple 2 or 3 minute videos like this</a> make all the difference.  Then there are all kinds of growth hacks to encourage users such as TGR's grom video contest that attracts some really good footage from amateur filmmakers.  Teach and enable the world to create better content on your platform and that will driive retention.</p>



            <p>The last concept, and the one I'm most excited about, is the potential for a github-like feature on a media content flatform.  If you're not very familiar with github, it is a platform for web developers to store the code for their projects online.  Another developer may (with permission) clone the developer's code from github to their own computer and work on that code to either fix bugs with the project or build upon the existing codebase to enhance the project further.  When they have made their changes they then push the code back online to github so the original creator can review the code and decide if they want to accept or decline the new changes.  If the original creator likes the changes then they're accepted and both contributors can now share the project.</p>

            <p>This would be ideal for a media content platform.  Athletes shoot hours and hours of footage, and hopefully they will shoot even more now that a Trace drone can replace their buddy and provide unique-angle footage.  However, the athletes are rarely the ones working on the edits.  Like most people, they prefer to leave the editing to people who are already talented with video editing software.  This would allow them to just upload all their footage, or stream it live from the field, and then anyone interested in editing that footage to create an edit would be able to.  So say a pro surfer went out for a couple hours on the North Shore and 3 hrs of new content was streamed live then stored on their Trace account.  Then fans from all around the world could clone that footage, personalize an edit, then push it back to the Trace network and both the athlete and the editor could share the edit and both parties would get their due credit.  This is a win/win for everybody because fans get quality footage to work on (if they want) and athletes/filmers get good edits which means more exposure which equates to more sponsorship dollars.  And Trace wins from the viral effect because now 3 hours of footage from 1 user just turned into potentially hundreds of hours of footage being created and shared by hundreds or thousands of fans/users.  This feature would open up connectioins and collaborations between athletes and fans that has never been seen before.</p>

            <p>A good example of how this already happens is my friend Odell Beckham Jr who plays for the NY Giants in the NFL.  He told me that he receives multiple edits of his pictures from fans daily who have screenshot his pics, edited, then reposted them on Instagram.  Adding this feature to your product would increase and encourage this type of behavior and also make sure that both parties get the credit they deserve for their effort.</p>
