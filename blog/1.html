            <p>17 Dec 2014</p>
            <p>I love Uber.  I really love Uber.  Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you I swear by it.  Do I agree with their current PR strategies?  No, and that's assuming they even have one.  Has the CEO done a little damage with a couple of his brash and arrogant quips?  Sure, but I don't know him personally so I don't know if it's a character issue or just a tactic.  What I do know is Uber's product is so good that they can survive all the bad press, lawsuits, and protests the world throws at them, and I think their fresh $40 billion+ valuation can back that up.  They are revolutionizing the way the world travels and smashing the monopolies of existing taxi providers.  This should be a lesson to all stale industries: either you continue to evolve and improve or the evolution of capitalism will eradicate your existence.  Tech and the internet are changing every industry so you must learn to adapt or get left behind.  That being said, a product always has the potential to get better, and I think there is something Uber can do to improve.</p>

            <p><em>The Problem: </em>On multiple occasions, I have requested an Uber and been incorrectly charged for a ride that I did not take.  The times this has happened to me I was trying to meet my driver after leaving a restaurant in a crowded area or following the end of a sporting event.  Now I certainly understand this complicates connecting a driver and the specific rider.  Since my card was charged in these instances I can only assume that someone else got in the car (knowingly acting as me or otherwise) and took the Uber to their destination.  I see how this could be a pretty common occurance with multiple people in an area requesting Uber rides.  The problem is this is not just a missed ride for a user like me.  Someone is getting my ride, but they are also getting that ride with the bill being charged to my credit card.</p>

            <p><em>The Solution: </em>I believe a good solution for this problem would be to issue a unique passenger code to the rider once a driver is confirmed and en route.  Then when you get into the Uber you simply tell the driver your unique issued code, the driver types it into his or her phone, and if it is the right passenger then the ride can begin.  If it is the wrong code then it notifies the driver that this is not the passenger they are supposed to be picking up.  This would be a simple and efficient solution before allowing someone to take a ride on the credit card tied to that account (all Uber rides are charged to the credit card on file with the user's account).  This would be similar in function to online shopping marketplaces asking for the secret code on a credit card.  It's just one more step to ensure that the person is verified to access the card on that Uber account.  It would provide a little more user confidence in Uber's security with data; something they haven't had an abundance of lately.  And if I've had this problem multiple times then I would dare guess that it is a pretty common occurance.</p>

            <p>**For the record, I would like to point out that every time this happens to me and I email customer service informing them of the error they have been fantastic in refunding me immediately, no questions asked.  Seriously, it's very impressive.  But if they could improve the product to correct this issue then I would definitely prefer that instead.**</p>
