            <h1 class="arrow">Uber 2</h1>
            <p>As I've <a href="../blog/1.html">written previously</a>, I'm a big fan of what Uber has built.  Those who are unfamiliar with Uber may not understand what all the hype is about, but they have undoubtedly heard of Uber's PR woes in the previous months.  I'll stay away from the instances where drivers have used <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Passenger-Hit-with-Hammer-by-Uber-Driver-278596821.html" target="_blank">hammers</a> or their <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-chicago-investigating-uber-driver-20141209-story.html" target="_blank">own phalic appendages</a> to indulge in criminal activity, but I will address an element of Uber's product that I feel could be improved upon and thus alleviate certain instances that turn into a nightmare in the press.  The issue I'm refering to is when a rider agrees to high surge pricing without realizing exactly what they're getting themselves into.  When the rider arrives and realizes their fare will require parting ways with multiple Benjamin Franklins it usually turns into a woe-is-me, throw stones at the Big Bad Wolf type smear campaign with social media and the press being the mediums of choice.  While the idiom "bad attention is better than no attention" generally holds true, so does "enough is enough."  It's about time Uber takes a few small measures to counteract this problem to help users and in the process help themselves - a "help me help you" situation just in case I haven't thrown in enough clich√©s.</p>

            <p>I'm not suggesting a large overhaul of the product, but I believe these small tweaks could help.  First, as shown in figure 1, I would add the minimum fare to the confirmation screen.  Currently this is not displayed unless you tap the "fare quote" button which then takes you to figure 2.  Lets simplify this by providing the user with the minimum fare on the confirmation screen.  This eliminates a user CTA to view the minimum fare and puts more ownice on the user.</p>

            <p>The other thing I would change could probaby be its own blog post, but since I've got you here let me run it by you.  I think the best opportunity for improvement would be the functionality of the Uber app while the user is taking a ride.  Many times I have gotten into the car and the driver has asked me which way to go.  I certainly don't expect drivers to have the city memorized, so I think it would be handy for all parties to have access to navigation.  Now we certainly don't want our drivers distracted, so once again lets put a little ownice on the rider.  Figure number 3 shows a proposed integration of the Waze app once the ride has begun (I imagine collaboration between Waze and Uber could be facilitated seeing as Google owns Waze and Google Ventures is a hefty investor in Uber).  Waze would be a great tool to integrate with Uber because it shows you the quickest route to your destination while also offering alternative routes to avoid traffic and delays.  You will see in the bottom of the screen where Waze shows the estimated time of arrival, time remaining, and distance remaining until you arrive at your destination.  My suggested additions are to add the running total fare and the estimated total fare of your current Uber ride.  This way the rider is aware of the driver's route and can verify they are going the right way and assist in giving directions if needed.  Also, the rider is aware of the cost of their ride at all times so they can avoid the shock-and-awe that sometimes greets users upon arrival at their destination.</p>

            <p>We've all heard about the massive amounts of data Uber collects and uses pertaining to their riders, and I'm fine with that.  But I would like to see a little kickback in data and information presented to users in real time.  If data and information help the company operate then it will certainly help the product as well.  And not to mention, it could help Uber stay out of the headlines for the wrong reasons.</p>
