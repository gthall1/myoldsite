            <p>The premise is pretty straight forward.  Social network > posts are bets > not actual money so it can be legal (but it could integrate with legal sports betting sites overseas, I'll get to this later).  Here on the home screen would be your feed very similar to the likes of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  Personalized to you dependent upon who you follow.  The posts, however, are all bets.  As you can see on the left side bar you have access to bet on all sports as well as lines such as halftimes and futures bets too.  The site supports multiple bet types including parlays, teasers, round robins, and if/reverse bets.</p>

            <p>When a user's bet is pending it is gray.  If the bet is a loss then it turns red and if it is a winning bet it turns green.  This is handy for quickly reviewing your timelines, your profile, or another user's betting history.  As you can see the common functionality of likes, sharing, and commenting is available in a non-invasive manner.</p>

            <p>The left and right side panels stay the same from page to page.  Additionally, the bet slip stays in place from screen to screen as well so you don't lose a bet you're working on if you browse to look at other lines or another user's bets.</p>

            <p>Betting is done in the form of whole integer units from 1-10.  A user has access to unlimited units, but bets can never exceed 10 units (nor be less than 1 unit).  I believe this is the most simple way to have a standardized system across the board for all users.  Initially you'd think everyone would just bet 10 units every bet, but I think people would quickly realize its much smarter to mimic a pro gambler's money management system or else they'll be in the negative numbers for total units (ha, just like in real life).  A user's overall units will be a good measurement of a user's betting over time, but (total units)/(total bets), or win %, will also be a useful user stat.  Users will be able to view the top bettors, and this can be broken down into more specific lists too by sport, bet type, season, etc (ex: top NCAAF bettors, top NFL under/over bettors, etc).</p>

            <p>Also, bets can only be placed in whole number units (1-10), but your winnings are returned rounded to one decimal to account for the vig and keep this as real as possible.  ex: risk 10 units on a line thats -105 then you win 9.5 units</p>

            <h1 class="arrow">Gamblr - Profile Page view</h1>
            <p>The profile view below gives you a visualization of what profiles look like and their functionality.  As you can see it lists name and username, along with the user's overall betting units.  User's name is not required in case a user is worried about their privacy.  Records are shown and it's pretty straightforward.  I think its good to show a user's overall record, but also I think it's helpful to show "last 30 bets" and "this week" to give more recent data.  I think the part where you can filter by sport is a pretty neat feature too.</p>

            <p>The concept of contests I think would be neat and kinda like the daily/weekly fantasy betting sites that have become so popular lately.  These could possible be for real money - not sure on legality yet.</p>

            <p>Once again, same concept in feed - gray, green, and red posts.  You can also filter this to show your own (or another user's) feed with only the filters you choose (ex. show only teasers, show only NHL, etc).  This would be a good way to quickly scroll through certain types of your bets.  I think this would be good to look at by, say, looking at all of your parlays.  You could scroll through your history and see they're all red so you'd know to quit doing that shit.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned earlier, the bet slip will always stay centered in place above your feed (much like your twitter or facebook post area works).  Pictured here is if you clicked on football > college football lines.  Check one of the boxes and that line goes to your bet slip; check multiple boxes then parlays, teasers, etc come into play.  Nothing revolutionary here, but once you have your line and the amount of units you want to risk you obviously hit review bet button.  Not pictured, but that's where you review bet before posting and can also add a comment (kinda like instagram process).  Hit submit and it goes to the feed for your followers to see, just like twitter.</p>
