            <p>- it is an online sweepstakes...you can't buy tickets, you can earn them</p>
            <p>- a "credit" is essentially a sweepstakes ticket</p>
            <p>- you play games to earn credits</p>
            <p>- your credits belong to you. You can deposit your credits into the "jackpot" where all users deposit their credits. Once the jackpot is full we randomly select a winner.  So, essentially a credit is like having a slip of paper with your name on it in a hat and us drawing one user to win the pot.  The more credits you have in the pot, the better chance you have to win</p>
            <p>- the winner is drawn when the pot reaches 100% capacity</p>

            <h1 class="arrow">Home Page view</h1>
            <p>I believe it is pretty self explanatory, but here is where you would choose which games you would like to play in order to earn credits. You can also see how full the current jackpot is, and the amount that the current jackpot is worth.  In the navigation bar you can see that you are the current user, as well as how many credits you currently have, and a button to deposit those credits into the jackpot when you want to do so.  The more users that are active on the site, the quicker the payouts, so it would be smart for users to invite as many people to play as they can.</p>

            <p>One completed game of solitaire would earn a user 45 credits.</p>
            <p>Average game of solitaire ~ 11:21 mins (1 credit per ~ 15 seconds)</p>

            <h1 class="arrow">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p><font color="red">Q:  Do I have to pay to play?</font></br>No, and in fact that would be illegal. That is how state run lotteries work. Our credits, and payouts, are generated by advertising dollars. We promise not to spam you with annoying popups and ads that detract from the user experience, but this is the reason ads are present throughout the games</p>
            <p><font color="red">Q:  Do I get locked out (like Candy Crush or Trivia Crack)?</font></br>No, that would be annoying. We want you to keep playing so you earn more credits and deposit them into the pot. The more you play and the more friends you invite the quicker the jackpot fills up. As soon as it is full we draw the winner. More people = more frequent payouts in larger amounts</p>
            <p><font color="red">Q:  What do you win if one of your credits is chosen?</font></br>Cold. Hard. Cash.</p>
            <p><font color="red">Q:  Seriously? I win real money in the amount of the jackpot?</font></br>Yes. Well we give you a check, but you get the point....no gimmicks</p>
            <p><font color="red">Q:  Is there just one jackpot?</font></br>For now yes, but we will expand to have a "mega jackpot" which will be the main jackpot, but also run simultaneous smaller jackpots like a daily jackpot, weekly jackpot, $500, $10,000, etc</p>
            <p><font color="red">Q:  What's the benefit of holding onto your credits and not immediately depositing them in the jackpot?</font></br>Your credits belong to you so you can deposit them when you see fit. If you would like to save them for weeks or months then deposit them all at the same time to improve your chances of winning a certain jackpot when you have hundreds or thousands of credits then you are welcome to do so.</p>
