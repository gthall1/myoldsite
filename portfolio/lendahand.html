            <h1 class="arrow">Lend A Hand</h1>
            <p>During my senior year of college our city took a direct hit from a large EF4 tornado that accounted for 64 deaths in Tuscaloosa, AL and over $2.4 billion worth of damage.  Once the crazy emotions subsided and the authorities had taken care of all the emergency situations we turned our focus to assisting in the clean up efforts throughout our community.  It was incredible to see all of the volunteers and the outpouring of support as we met people who had travelled to Alabama from as far as Oklahoma and Michigan just to lend a hand in the relief efforts.  But as awesome as the vounteers were, the coordination of the relief efforts was a disaster.  There would be 25 people putting a tarp on a roof, and then a mile down the road there would be no one helping an elderly couple remove trees from their driveway preventing them from leaving their home.  I decided there had to be a better way.</p>

            <p>I built IWillLendaHand.org to connect people who are in need with volunteers who are willing to lend them a hand.  This could mean assistance in dire times after a disaster or just a simple task around the house that requires a little help.  As I saw in the days following my personal experience with disaster, there are so many people who are willing to lend a hand, they just need to know where they're needed most.</p>
