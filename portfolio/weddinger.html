            <h1 class="arrow">Weddinger</h1>
            <p>Hey Chris and team.  Here's what I've worked on to create a model with the info I took away from our chat the other day.  I know we concluded that there must be an emphasis on scheduling as this is the main problem you guys are trying to address.  Also, sorry, I didn't know if y'all had a name so as I was working with it I just threw together wedding + singer and used Weddinger.  Obviously all the copy, logo, layouts, etc can be swapped, modified, etc, but I wanted to give you guys a visual interpretation of what I had heard in our meeting the other day and make sure we are on the same page.  Take a stroll through this, throw any and all questions my way, and we'll see what you guys want to add, take away, your thoughts, etc and we'll see if we can't come up with a plan to move forward if you guys want.</p>

            <p>The first screen below would be the home page that a user would land on.  They are not logged in, so none of their info is saved.  The have the option to put in their location and their date, as well as choose the type vendor they are looking for and quickly search.  Just the logo and name of the site in top left, as well as pretty obvious links in top right.  I'd recommend a subtle button in plain sight for vendors which makes it obvious where they can sign up, that's why this is the purple shade.  You don't want it too loud though because the majority of your users won't be vendors.  Below are just some categories that could be useful.  You guys might have some other ideas for this space, but I wanted to put something here to give you an idea of what was possible.  This could also be a source of revenue if you guys wanted to charge people to be listed in this space as a form of native advertising; just a thought.</p>

            <p>Once you searched it would be a list of all the available bands on those dates.  We could either hide those bands that are booked, or just shade them out; your choice but that page is pretty simple and straightforward.</p>

            <h1 class="arrow">Band page</h1>
            <p>The is the band's page, or profile screen if you will.  You get here when you click on a band from the search results page (not shown).  As you can see, you have a profile pic, background pic, band name, slogan, social media links, videos, pictures, and a band description.  These are the things that I thought were pretty obvious that people would want.  The big question I had is are you looking for the ability for people to leave reviews as well?  Do you want users to be able to go on this site and upload reviews?  Do you want the band to enter reviews?  Link to another page where the band has been reviewed?  I didn't know all these answers, and I know you had mentioned linking to Dunwello, but I'll let you guys talk through this and let me know what you guys are thinking.</p>

            <p>Pretty straightforward, I hope, on the calendar.  If the band is booked then that specific date will appeared shaded red.  There are plenty of different variations we could do with this, but I figured this wouldn't be a bad place to start.</p>

            <h1 class="arrow">Edit Profile Page</h1>
            <p>Here is the "edit profile screen".  This will be the look when a vendor first signs up (if they clicked the vendor signup button on the homepage and after they went through the onboarding/signup process).  All simple text fields and uploading media from your computer's files.</p>

            <p>I know we had discussed making the ability to update a vendor's schedule very easy, so I thought nothing would be easier than checking a box.  The vendor would simply check the dates they were booked and click save at the bottom of the screen.  Then on their profile page those dates would be shaded red, and they would not appear in the search results for those dates (or they would be shaded).</p>
