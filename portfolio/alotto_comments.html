            <p>"Griff, Thanks for coming by and meeting with us.  To answer your question and to compliment our discussion Tuesday, keep grinding.  We were impressed with your competitive mentality and clear vision; believe me those are things that get us excited.  We promised we would give it to you straight, always.  We see you as having 7 of our  12 key indicators.  The good news is the ones you're missing are all attainable with the most important being your team.  I can't stress how important it is to find others who are excited about what you're building because you need a strong team when things get tough.  Your perception of equity distribution was good in our opinion and should be dependent on caliber of cofounder.  Find someone you like and mkae sure they're impressive.  The other 4 factors shoud fall into place thereafter: mvp, traction, monetization strategy (which arguably you already have), and your scale strategy.</br>Son, in short, we like what you're doing.  Hell, [redacted] can't stop talking about the potential if you bring this together.  When we see 12 out of 12 on our factor board we believe we'll have some exciting things to talk about.  Stay in touch because I would like updates on your progress.</br>Good Fortune,</br>[redacted]</p>

            <p>I appreciate you coming in to meet with us and I believe I speak for [redacted] and [redacted] when I say we like what you're working on.  Your project is not only disruptive but in the right hands this could be one of the 'boomers' I was talking about.  You seem to be knowledgable and grounded, and you're going to need that in the coming weeks + months.  [redacted] is going to be tasked with checking in on you in the coming days to see how you're progressing.  If you address the large obstacles of bringing in a quality team around you and showing traction with this MVP then our next steps can flow smoothly and in short order.  Stay in touch with [redacted] so we're up to date on your progress.</br>Talk Soon,</br>[redacted]</p>

            <p>Griff! No problem, glad I could put you in touch with them, big guy! Told ya that you would do fine.  The important thing is that you have taken the steps to establish a relationship with them without asking for money.  That's a common rookie mistake and I know you've raised money before but believe me that goes a long way out here in the Valley with these guys.</br>Stick with the approach we talked about Wednesday night.  And I'm going to talk to Sedhap and her friend about co-founders.  I know you've got good instincts but these are big decisions and my recommendation is to cast a wide net but ultimately trust your gut and I'll see about intros.  We'll find a stud!</br>Shoot me the itinerary of your BC trip and lets see if we cross while I'm in Vancouver.  Hopefully we can sit down and talk progress and next steps.  I'm exited for ya man, and if what I'm hearing from these guys is any indication then it's gonna be a wild ride!  Ski hard and stay safe out there, and I'll tell [redacted] you said hello!</p>

            <p>"Seriously, I want to get involved.  Let me know when you're realistic about raising a smaller round to get you guys started. I'm excited, and I can feel you are too.  Let's go!  What's next?"</p>

            <p>"looks great. simple concept. Would almost be cooler if it was trivia questions instead of games. And similar to trivia crack, the user can have the option to create the questions to keep them new and continuous. Just a thought.  I'm ready to fund once you get it (functioning prototype) goin"</p>
            <p>"Griff! That's amazing. Can I forward to my friends??  Seriously love it love it"  "Okay! Yeah let me know when I can spread the word.  That's gonna be great"  "The ideas that work are the ones where your like 'why hasn't someone already done this?' and that's how I feel about this it's really great"</p>
            <p>"I like it. My one wish would be for a site like that that doesn't bog down with pop ups and shit. Fast, smooth gameplay means a lot, IMO. Makes you feel like you're not about to get 19 viruses if you click the next card"</p>
            <p>"Right on man.  I've given it an initial look over...now I'm going to let it digest for a couple hours and I'll get you a better thought out response tonight / early tomorrow / and take the survey.

            Initial thoughts... a little of a chicken / egg scenario in which comes first the users or the advertisers, but definitely not something that can't be overcome especially with the right sales team

            Legally would have to do a little more digging, but my knowledge of lotto law as it stands now I don't think this should present any issues as you have to make a purchase for it to be considered a lotto... free is free

            I'm sure you're already ten steps ahead on this... but this idea in an ap to me is 1000 times better...

            Will follow up more in a bit, but like the bones of this one!!!"</p>
            <p>"No joke I think you’re on to something here."  "But I think old women and little high school kids would love this shit.  I used to play centsports all the time.  I have old women in hospitals constantly trying to sign me up for these dumbass apps so they can get points for discounts at walmart and stuff.  heck, i remember putting $10 in to those old online penny auction sites and trying to win iPads.  Well done sir."  "It's a good idea.  Don't blow it."
            </p>
            <p>"I think it will be more user friendly when it is more interactive for sure. Really swell idea."</p>
            <p>"Not gonna lie, I like this model a lot. More than the the Gamblr concept. I think you’ve got a real way to make money, which is important ;-). The ways to advertise (outside of the backside of solitaire cards) will continue to evolve and you can get creative in finding other streams of revenue. I think your main focus at this point should be, “how can we make each and every millennial on the face of the earth think about our jackpot/game model when they’re bored or in need of a time waster?” It might be a guerrilla marketing plan, could just be word of mouth, or could be making the jackpot large enough to really attract some attention. You’ve got to start somewhere and beginning with a $1 million dollar jackpot doesn’t seem logical with the assumption that there’s not an abundant amount of funding backing the venture.

            My first thought about getting the word out in the fastest manner possible…create a viral video. Tough to do, easier said than done – I know. But I think you’ve got something where there’s an opportunity cost incurred by anyone that chooses not to play/enjoy the benefits of playing your game and entering your jackpot. As opposed to playing the solitaire or card game that has no reward or possible benefit. I thought about how Facebook is literally a news feed of viral videos. Maybe FB shows me those videos cause I’m the goober that watches some of them, but it’s how people are spreading the word about something these days.

            Is this your concept or someone else’s that you’ve been contracted to work on? Is there another concept out there like this? From a 30,000 ft. view, I am concerned about the lack of barriers to entry. If I’m Mark Cuban, I could build another website and app tomorrow and make it as cool as Griff’s idea. That’s how those guys think, as you well know.
            Because of a lack of barriers to entry, and if you are one of the first to come up with such a concept, and this is a venture that you ultimately believe will work long-term - I would pursue the highest level of protection in terms of intellectual property."</p>
            <p>"Cool concept, I played the matching game and would use this more often if I had more time and maybe if it was an app. I will definitely recommend this to my mamaw and [redacted]'s because she plays online games all the time but she would love the whole jackpot and lottery concept!"</p>
            <p>"Love the idea!!!!"</p>
            <p>"Question, how will you market this? I think it's a great idea, especially because people like winning money and playing games. I think a mobile app would be key"   "I like it a lot. Love the concept"</p>
            <p>"Pretty cool concept you have there"</p>
            <p>"Awesome, yeah that all makes sense.  Sounds totally reasonable to me"</p>
            <p>"Man I'm really impressed big guy."</p>
            <p>"Thanks for sharing your project with us.  This is a great idea for brand marketing. Would definitely have to be the big companies that don’t need to say anything because you recognize the brand from the logo! I love the silence :)  I’ll make one recommendation to you in the wording of your instructions… maybe replace ‘users’ with ‘players’… just a thought!  My mom would be all over it!  Let me know when you launch."</p>
